  Into the unknown | 50 x 70 cm | Acrylic on canvas.

What started as a study in technique became a mirror.
A portrait of transition — abstract, ambiguous, yet grounded.
I know where I’m heading.
I’m guided by purpose, pulled by vision.
And even though the details are still forming,
I trust the shape they’ll take.
This painting holds that moment —
of stepping forward,
not with certai nty,
but with clarity of direction
and excitement for all that’s yet to become.
