"Three faces. One moment.
This new work explores the tension between intimacy and distance — the quiet choreography of glances, silences, and presence.
Two faces side by side, almost touching — united.
A third, observing from the edge — caught between admiration and detachment.
Minimal in form, layered in feeling."
