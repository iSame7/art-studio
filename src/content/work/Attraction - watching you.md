"Attraction - Watching you" (2025) is an original painting by Sameh Mabrouk.

Watching You is a reflection on silent connections and unspoken attraction. Inspired by my observations at a café, this painting captures the subtle intensity of being watched—of stolen glances, quiet curiosity, and the magnetic pull between strangers. Through bold forms and refined strokes, I explore the tension between presence and distance, awareness and mystery. This piece is a visual study of attraction, where gaze becomes language, and silence speaks volumes.

Medium: Acrylic on canvas.\
Size: 50*70 cm.
