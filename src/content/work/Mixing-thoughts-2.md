In this piece, a solitary face emerges through color fields—quietly watching, quietly felt.
It’s part of the same universe as Collecting Thoughts, yet this time, there is someone at the center.
A moment where thought becomes form. Presence becomes a witness.
A meditation on stillness, visibility, and the layers we carry inside.
