"Still life - Food for thoughts" (2025) is an original painting by Sameh Mabrouk.

Daily Rituals in Ink – This minimalist still life painting is a reflection of the simple yet meaningful moments that shape my everyday life. Inspired by the food and objects I encounter daily—coffee, a vase, croissants, water, lemon—each element is stripped to its essence, captured in bold strokes of black ink on canvas. The composition balances contrast and negative space, inviting the viewer to find beauty in the ordinary. A quiet homage to the routines that bring comfort and rhythm to my day, this piece celebrates the elegance of everyday objects through a raw and intentional simplicity.

Medium: Acrylic and Ink on canvas.\
Size: 50*70 cm.
