"Still life - Coffee table" (2024) is an original painting by Sameh Mabrouk.

Inspired by the iconic simplicity of Klaas Gubbels, this painting reimagines the timeless still life of coffee culture. With a minimalistic palette and bold, abstract shapes, it captures the essence of everyday momentsâ€”a coffee pot and cup resting on a table. The subtle interplay of titanium white and buff tones creates a serene atmosphere, inviting the viewer to pause and reflect on the quiet beauty in the ordinary.

Medium: Acrylic on canvas.\
Size: 50*70 cm.
