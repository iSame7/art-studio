"Attraction - Admiring you" (2025) is an original painting by Sameh Mabrouk.

"Admiring You" captures the quiet intensity of attractionâ€”an unspoken dialogue between observer and observed. Inspired by fleeting moments of connection, this piece explores the gaze, the way we admire from a distance, caught between curiosity and contemplation. With bold, minimal strokes, the painting evokes a sense of mystery, intimacy, and quiet admiration. The composition plays with presence and absence, leaving space for the viewer to step into the moment and feel the silent pull of attention.

Medium: Acrylic on canvas.\
Size: 50*70 cm.
