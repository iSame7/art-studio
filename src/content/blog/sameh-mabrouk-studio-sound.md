The first Sameh Mabrouk Studios playlist is curated by me, bringing my art to life through sound.

\
&nbsp;
"samehmabrouk.studio / sound 01" sets the perfect vibe for a chill night with friendsâ€”dim lighting, casual conversations, and a table that's stylishly unpolished. But it's just as fitting for those long hours in the studio when you're in the zone. With mostly instrumental tracks, it keeps your focus locked in without breaking the flow.

\
&nbsp;
A smooth blend of jazz, soul, and house, paired with a raw picture of me in the studio, deep in the creative grind.

You can now find the playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5PB4jDcFJddwTT0khtyd3A?si=KS-HgtbXTLKeGxxNXAiZ5A).

I hope you it inspire you in your creative journey.
