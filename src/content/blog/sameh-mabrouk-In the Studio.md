You may already be familiar with Sameh Mabrouk’s visual world — abstract yet intimate, carefully stripped down yet emotionally rich. His work lives in the quiet space between reality and imagination, drawing on personal moments, fleeting observations, and an ongoing search for beauty in simplicity.

\
Based in Amsterdam, Sameh is a self-taught artist with a background in computer science and mobile engineering. When he’s not writing lines of code, he turns to canvas and paper, using those same lines to sketch out bodies, landscapes, and shapes — always seductive in their minimalism, always open to interpretation.

\
His artistic process is rooted in emotion rather than perfection. Each piece often begins as a rough line, a vague idea, or a memory, and slowly takes shape through a dialogue between imagination and the hand. Ink, acrylic, and oil are his chosen tools, offering flexibility between quick, spontaneous expression and carefully layered compositions.

\
What unites his body of work is an ongoing search for “the perfect line” — a line that speaks more to the viewer's feeling than to technical correctness. Sometimes it takes starting over, sometimes stepping away, but the goal remains: to express beauty in its most refined, honest form.

\
Whether you encounter his work on a blank wall or during one of his exhibitions, it always invites you into an open conversation — one where silence, space, and subtlety carry as much weight as the visible brushstrokes.

\
Sameh’s universe isn’t built on references or reproductions, but on imagination and lived experience. Every artwork is an invitation to slow down and see beyond the surface, to let curiosity and emotion lead the way.

      <p> <strong>Inspiration ---</strong> 
      This piece is part of my Attraction series, a body of work inspired by quiet, intimate moments of observation — moments I often encounter during my time at one of my favorite neighborhood cafés.

There’s something beautifully raw about those fleeting exchanges: the silent tension, the unspoken glances, the way attraction can exist entirely in the space between two strangers without a single word. Sometimes the connection is so subtle it's almost imperceptible; other times, it lingers long enough to stir a deeper sense of curiosity, even arousal.

Attraction – Admiring You is my attempt to translate that experience onto canvas. Through minimal yet suggestive strokes, I aim to capture the quiet power of admiration — that internal dialogue of desire, wonder, and imagination that plays out when the gaze lingers just a little too long.

In this work, the viewer is invited to step into that moment of silent connection and experience the subtle tension between distance and longing.

<p> <strong>My Aesthetic ---</strong> 
This work also reflects the essence of my artistic aesthetic: natural simplicity combined with the boldness of chroma — a language of refined lines and vibrant restraint. In Attraction – Admiring You, this approach reflects the quiet intensity of an unspoken connection, distilled into minimal yet suggestive forms that invite the viewer into a moment of silent longing. My approach leans toward reduction, where simplicity sharpens emotion and composition, and where the absence of detail invites the viewer to fill the gaps with their own imagination.

In this work, the viewer is invited to step into that moment of silent connection and experience the subtle tension between distance and longing.

<p> <strong>Creative outlets ---</strong> 
Beyond painting, I enjoy exploring product design, ceramics, sculpture, fashion design, and even practicing guitar. For me, painting and drawing serve as the foundation for all of these creative endeavors. Whether it’s sketching an idea for a product or visualizing a new design, I see the act of drawing as the starting point that brings everything else to life, from concept to reality.

</p>

<br />
<p> <strong>My future creative journey---</strong> 
Looking ahead, I am focused on self-study and refining my artistic practice and techniques. My primary goal is to continue developing my work with distinction, while deepening my understanding of the creative process. I’ve always been drawn to creating art that engages with the land, especially in more sculptural forms. The challenge of working on a larger scale is something that truly excites me, and I’m eager to explore this dimension of my creativity in the future.
